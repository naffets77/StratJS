-- Current State of the Game --

A planet is available for a starting point for the player user. They can "Search" for new paths, 
or they can explore the path already found. Once a path has been explored the planet at the end of 
the path becomes the players planet. 


-- TO Do --

3. Fog of War should cover the map based on your visibility range based on your stats

6. Create fleet way-point management

7. Hook up created ships to way-points

8. Way-point allocation UI

9. Figure out how fleet-to-planet and fleet-to-fleet battles work

11. Make sure to remove event handlers for UI elements that are not visible (i.e. exploring new paths)

12. Make sure generated planets and paths make sense. Make sure paths and planets don't overlap?

13. Create UI to show 3rd 'overview' w/detailed bonuses

15. Build out planetary infrastructure 

17. Create UI For queuing ship construction

18. Create UI For assigning ships to waypoints (will also need to create the waypoint management UI)

19. Finish Planet UI

21. Order found paths for waypoint to a new planet by lenght (waypoint.js line 164)

22. Handle exploring a planet that is owned by another player. (Player Line 572)

23.

Done

1. Hook up UI for upgrading stats

2. Planets found should have another action to make them acquired. You can only acquire a planet if it 
has a link to your systems. Depending on your stats you may only be able to 'see' so far and will have to 're-explore' a 
path in order to acquire a planet that you didn't when you first explored the path. [NOPE]

4. Planets that are owned by a different player cannot be acquired unless attacked by a fleet.  [Currently Do Not Get Acquired]

5. Hook up resources based on stats and planets owned [Planets Hooked Up]

10. Figure out Cost and Factor in Cost of Exploration & Path Finding

16. Make planets clickable and show up in the UI

20. Finish stats tree for the rest of stats

14. Make it so that the exploring/discovering doesn't occur backwards in the UI
